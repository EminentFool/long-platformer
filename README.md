a game designed to be terrible.

This game was created by me in order to parody the lackluster projects my peers had submitted for a class. It is intentionally terrible. Although a few levels may seem impossible, they are not. Wording of splash text on some levels is important. The end of the game is clear, with a yellow background and some text that says "Congratulations, you beat me". If you have not reached that stage, you have not won.

Controls are arrow keys to move, R to restart in case you get stuck. Pressing R after the checkpoint will only send you to the checkpoint, not back to the beginning.

this game has gone through extensive playtesting, especially with the green avatar. If something does not appear to be working, try playing it through with the green avatar. There are many intentional bugs. Very many. Please be wary of this as you report them.
